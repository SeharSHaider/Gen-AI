    "# PA2.2 Part B - Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Based Music Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be generating Music (no vocals though) using an HMM via [Baum-Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) Training Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Music Generation, the states might represent underlying musical concepts (like note pitches or chord types), and observations could be specific notes or chords played at a given time. Hence, generating music involves moving through the states based on transition probabilities and producing musical notes based on the emission probabilities associated with each state. The emission probabilities dictate how likely it is to observe each possible note or chord (observation symbol) when in a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "__Baum Welch__: is an __*Unsupervised*__ training algorithm that involves adjusting the HMM's parameters (transition, emission, and initial state probabilities) to best account for the observed sequences.The training process involves:\n",
    "- Expectation step (E-step): Estimate the likely sequences of hidden states (could be something implicit like musical concepts like chords or rhythms) given the current parameters of the model and the observed data.\n",
    "- Maximization step (M-step): Update the model's parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data, based on the estimated sequences of hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Baum Welch](unsupervised_learning.png)\n",

    "    - a hidden_state_size (default to 10), higher values capture more variability but converge slowly.\n",
    "    - a tuple of all the unique \n",
    "    - a dictionary for mapping the pitches to its unique integer identifier.\n",
    "    - some additional variables to reduce code redundancy in latter parts such as len()\n",
    "    - Transition, Emission and Initial State Probability Matrices which are initialized to Zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `init_mat(self, init_scheme='uniform')`: __(Can Be Modified)__ initializes the transition, emission and probability matrices either with a 'uniform' value or values sampled randomly from a uniform distribution and normalizes the matrice row wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `forward(self, sequence)`: __(To Be Implemented)__ implements the Forward stage of the Forward-Backward Algorithm. \n",

    "smaller values of alpha and beta. Hence, wherever division occurs, the denominator variable (which is a result of multiplication with alpha or beta) is close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll now suggest some ways with which the third point can be alleviated __(the hacky ways might/might not work, so be wary)__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hacky way #1 (Working with smaller chunks of observed sequences): For every iteration, rather than going over the concatenated music sequences or each music sequence, you can further break down your musical sequences into even smaller chunks and go over those instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hacky way #2 (Add a small epsilon value to the denominator): Add a small episilon value like 1e-12 to the denominator wherever the division by 0 error occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Proper way #1 (The [log-sum-exp](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/02/09/log-sum-exp/) trick): For an HMM, the smaller values can be dealt with by passing them through\n",

    "    - This HMM github [repo](https://github.com/jwmi/HMM/blob/master/hmm.jl) has implemented the log-sum-exp trick in julia language.\n",
